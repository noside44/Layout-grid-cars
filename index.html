Because of their versatility, several types of motorsports involve racing off-road vehicles. A common use of these vehicles is for sight-seeing in areas that are unpaved and in the wilderness.

            <p>Luxury</p>
            <p>A common theme is of an older car of historical interest to be collectible and tend to be restored rather than scrapped, though sometimes age is not a factor. Classic cars are often considered a subset of a broader category of "collector cars" (which includes both restored classic cars vehicles and newer exotic vehicles)</p>

            <p>As regards valuation of different car models, it has been demonstrated that classic car model values are determined by observable characteristics pertaining to aesthetics, rarity, engineering and performance. In addition, classic car marques play a critical role in the determination of model values and account for considerable variation in values, even after controlling for observable classic car attributes</p>
